                        I'm diving deep into finding the best tools for prospecting new customers and could use your help. Has anyone here
                        tried <span class="bg-warning">PeopleDataLabs</span> or similar platforms? I'd love to hear about your
                        experiences, what worked, what didn't, and any tips you might have.

Hey there! When it comes to choosing a data vendor for your marketing app, I've had some experience comparing Proxycurl and People Data Labs. Here's what I've found:

Proxycurl is pretty impressive because it offers really fresh data—nothing older than 29 days. This is crucial if you want the most up-to-date information. Plus, it's way more cost-effective. We're talking about $0.01 per profile with Proxycurl, compared to around $0.20 with People Data Labs. That's a huge difference, especially if you're working with a tight budget.

On the other hand, People Data Labs has a solid search function, which can be handy if you need to filter profiles based on specific criteria. But if fresh data and cost are your main concerns, I'd lean towards Proxycurl.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.</textarea>

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      I've just started at a new company and they have a really good product for outbound but i've not set it up before. I'd
                      seen <span class="bg-warning">Lusha</span> in the past looked good for assembling prospecting lists but i'm struggling to get it to let me do industry
                      focused prospect searches. The company is fairly small and cash is tight so i think something that isn't a yearly
                      upfront fee would be good
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Does anyone have any recommendations for a tool for generating prospecting lists? Needs to have data that works for
                      Australian companies

At 8 am sharp I get a call from them but send it to VM because I&apos;m still getting ready; then, at 10 am sharp I get another call from a third different rep and they still didn&apos;t believe me about having an error on my screen and cannot process the fact I don&apos;t want to talk to them...
